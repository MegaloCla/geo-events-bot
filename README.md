The default thresholds set are:
- Minimum magnitude reported = 2
- Polling data interval = 5 seconds

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed before proceeding with the installation:

   ```bash
   docker build -t geo-events-bot .
   ```
2. Run the Docker container:

   ```bash
   docker run --env-file .env geo-events-bot
   ```

Make sure not to include the `.env` file in the repository by adding it to the `.dockerignore` file.
